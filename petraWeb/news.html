<p align ="center"><b>Petra city</b></p>
<pre >Petra is an ancient city located in present-day Jordan, known for its historical and archaeological significance.
 
It was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom and is sometimes referred to as the "Rose City" due to the color of the stone out of which it is carved.

 Petra was established around the 6th century BCE and flourished as an important trading hub due to its strategic location along the caravan routes 
 between Arabia,Egypt,and Syria-Phoenicia.
 The city's prosperity was largely based on its control of the trade in frankincense, myrrh, and spices.

One of the most iconic structures in Petra is Al-Khazneh ("The Treasury"), which is a grand temple carved into a rock face.
 It is believed to have been built in the 1st century CE and is an impressive example of the intricate rock-cut architecture for which Petra is famous.
 The Monastery, the High Place of Sacrifice, and the Roman Theater are among the other notable archaeological sites within Petra.

Petra's importance declined in the 3rd century CE due to changes in trade routes,
 and the city was eventually abandoned and largely forgotten by the Western world until it was rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812.
 Since then, it has become a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Today, visitors can explore the ancient city of Petra, marvel at its rock-cut architecture, and learn about its fascinating history.

<h1 >Royal Tombs:</h1>



<pre >
The Royal Tombs of Petra embody the unique artistry of the Nabateans while also giving display to Hellenistic architecture, 
but the façades of these tombs have worn due to natural decay.
 One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. 
The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury.    
 The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb.
 The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church after the expansion of Christianity in 446 AD

<h1>Access routes (siq)</h1>

 <img src="siq.jpg" title="Me" alt="Me" align="right" high="200" width="350"/>

<pre>
In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra,
around Jabal Haroun ("Aaron's Mountain"),the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses.
 Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north.
 Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east.
 The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge,
 in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq ("shaft"),
 a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.
